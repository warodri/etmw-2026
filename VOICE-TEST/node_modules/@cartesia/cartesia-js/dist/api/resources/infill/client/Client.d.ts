     * Generate audio that smoothly connects two existing audio segments. This is useful for inserting new speech between existing speech segments while maintaining natural transitions.
     *
     * **The cost is 1 credit per character of the infill text plus a fixed cost of 300 credits.**
     *
     * Infilling is only available on `sonic-2` at this time.
     *
     * At least one of `left_audio` or `right_audio` must be provided.
     *
     * As with all generative models, there's some inherent variability, but here's some tips we recommend to get the best results from infill:
     * - Use longer infill transcripts
     *   - This gives the model more flexibility to adapt to the rest of the audio
     * - Target natural pauses in the audio when deciding where to clip
     *   - This means you don't need word-level timestamps to be as precise
     * - Clip right up to the start and end of the audio segment you want infilled, keeping as much silence in the left/right audio segments as possible
     *   - This helps the model generate more natural transitions
